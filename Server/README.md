# HRM_Backend

now leave the direct attendance data retrieval from the server. 

make a cron job that does the data-retrieval from the local system for now.
(you will eventually figure it out later.)

make a util app that reads the attendance sent by the machine and store it in our mongo db.

focus on how that data will be read and sent to db.
